      1 - Abaddon tries its best (though is not perfect) to make Discord think it&apos;s a legitimate web client. Some of the things done to do this include: using a browser user agent, sending the same IDENTIFY message that the official web client does, using API v9 endpoints in all cases, and not using endpoints the web client does not normally use. There are still a few smaller inconsistencies, however. For example the web client sends lots of telemetry via the /science endpoint (uBlock origin stops this) as well as in the headers of all requests.

      See here for things you might want to avoid if you are worried about being caught in the spam filter.

      2 - Unicode emojis are substituted manually as opposed to rendered by GTK on non-Windows platforms. This can be changed with the stock_emojis setting as shown at the bottom of this README. A CBDT-based font using Twemoji is provided to allow GTK to render emojis natively on Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      3 - There are some inconsistencies with thread state that might be encountered in some more uncommon cases, but they are the result of fundamental issues with Discord&apos;s thread implementation.
